Launching a Static Website using S3 Bucket and CloudFront
1. Create S3 Bucket:
    * Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    * Click on "Create bucket".
    * Enter the domain name as the bucket name (e.g., example.com). Ensure the bucket name is globally unique.
    * Uncheck all "Block Access" options and enable ACL.
    * Click "Create bucket".
2. Upload Web Content:
    * Open the newly created bucket and upload all files and folders of your web content. 
    * Select all content, click on "Actions", and then click on "Make public using ACL".
3. Configure Static Website Hosting:
    * Go to the "Properties" tab of your bucket and scroll to the bottom.
    * Click on "Static Website Hosting" and enable it.
    * Enter the name of your index file and error file (if any).
    * Save the configuration.
4. Obtain Website URL:
    * Once the configuration is saved, you will get a website URL. You can check your web content with this link.
5. Configure Route 53:
    * Go to the Route 53 service in the AWS Management Console.
    * Create a new Hosted Zone with your domain name.
    * Create an 'A' record and enable the "Alias" option.
    * Choose the S3 endpoint as the Alias target and select the region where your S3 bucket is located. 
      Once you select the correct region, you will see the name of your S3 bucket listed as an option below.
    * Click on "Create Record".
6. Update NS Records: 
    * Update the NS records with your domain registrar.
    * Remove the "." from the end of each NS record.
7. Setup CloudFront:
    * Go to the CloudFront service in the AWS Management Console.
    * Click on "Create Distribution".
    * Choose "Amazon S3" as the origin domain and click "Use website endpoint".
    * Keep origin access public and other settings as default.
    * Click on "Create Distribution".
8. Access Your Website:
    * Once the CloudFront distribution is created, your website will be accessible globally.
